description: Implement the approved plan without introducing bloat.
---

Work directly from the active plan we have been discussing. If a planning document is available, iterate through each phase incrementally—implement, test, and seek user feedback before moving to the next phase. Mark completed steps with `[x]` and update the plan if scope or approach shifts.

Before implementing new functionality, verify that existing features affected by your changes still work. If you discover broken state, report it to the user before proceeding.

While coding, adhere strictly to the minimalist philosophy originally outlined: avoid hacks, fallback mechanisms, or any form of bloat. Keep implementations clean, modular, and pattern-aligned.

At the end of each phase, ensure the code is in a clean, reviewable state—no half-implemented features, no commented-out debugging code, no broken imports.

If the work touches UI or UX, follow the principles and best practices championed by top research design labs.
