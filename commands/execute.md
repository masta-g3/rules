description: Implement the approved plan without introducing bloat.
---

Work directly from the active plan we have been discussing. If a planning document is available, iterate through each phase incrementally—implement, test, and seek user feedback before moving to the next phase. Mark completed steps with `[x]` and update the plan if scope or approach shifts.

While coding, adhere strictly to the minimalist philosophy originally outlined: avoid hacks, fallback mechanisms, or any form of bloat. Keep implementations clean, modular, and pattern-aligned.

If the work touches UI or UX, follow the principles and best practices championed by top research design labs—clarity, accessibility, and disciplined craftsmanship should guide every decision.
