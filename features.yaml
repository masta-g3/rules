    - Filter archived projects from default portfolio view
    - Add toggle to show/hide archived (extend filter modes or separate key)
    - Add archive action in portfolio view (e.g. A key on selected project)
    - Create/remove .archived file to toggle state
    - Add visual indicator for archived projects when shown
